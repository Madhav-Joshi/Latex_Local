\begin{abstract}
    In this term project I created a (virtual) model and simulated the mechanism chosen in Assignment 1 using a mechanism simulation software Adams. The model is be used to generate displacement, velocity and acceleration curves of the important components of the machine. The model has been validated against some theoretical (manual) calculations. These details have been compiled in the form of the following report.
