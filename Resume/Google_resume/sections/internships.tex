\begin{itemize}
    \item Examined open source \textbf{SOFA framework} targeting real time for interfacing mesh, solvers, collision models and material properties to simulate a soft robot
    \item Implemented a research paper on soft robot system modeling using Koopman operator and MPC control on compliant springs with strings coupled with brushed DC motors
    \item Utilized Raspberry Pi 4B as a controller to interface various hardware components such as camera, Arduinos, and a PWM driver (PCA9685) using the I2C communication protocol
    \item Installed ROS on Raspbian OS and developed a ROS package that can be scaled to accommodate more complex robots with controller accuracy of \boldmath{\(\pm 3\)} \textbf{mm}
